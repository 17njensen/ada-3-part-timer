# ada-3-part-timer
Programmed in ADA for an Embedded Systems course

Part 4) This process has three timers:
F1 - executes every second with an execution time of 0.3 sec
F2 - executes immediately after F1 with an execution time of 0.15 sec
F3 - executes 0.5 sec after F1 starts and executes for 0.2 sec

Part 5) This process is the exect same as Part 4, but implements a fake "missed deadline" for F3 using random numbers
